# Neural-classifier-with-numpy

Practical introduction to coding a neural network without advanced DL-frameworks <br/>
Part of the course "General Artifical Intelligence" at HRW.

## Goals
Create a neural classifier from scratch, which should classify points in a circle of radius r. <br/>
Learning objectives include: <br/>
  - implement forward-pass and backpropagation <br/>
  - inspect the decision boundary of a classifier and build an intuition for the relation between activation function and structure of the boundary
  - investigate the effect of implicit feature engineering by a neural network
  - perform explicit feature engineering and analyze the benefit for the specific task at hand
